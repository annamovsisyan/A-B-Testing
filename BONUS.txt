To improve the bandit algorithm comparison project, it is better to structure the code into clear modules for each type of algorithm, data management, and visualization. Then use configuration files to easily adjust parameters, enhance visualizations with interactive tools like Plotly, and add statistical analysis for deeper insights. It would be good to incorporate error handling, logging, and optimize for performance. Using unit testing to ensure reliability and adding the documentation part can be useful. I think this approach will make the project more robust, user-friendly, and adaptable to changes(due to being open source on GitHub).
